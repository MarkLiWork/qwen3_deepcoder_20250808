James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week? Let's think step by step and output the final answer after "####".

Okay, let's see. James is running 3 sprints three times a week. Each sprint is 60 meters. I need to find out how many meters he runs in a week.

First, I should figure out how many sprints he does in a week. He does 3 sprints each day, and that's three times a week. So, 3 sprints/day multiplied by 3 days/week. Let me calculate that: 3 times 3 is 9. So, he does 9 sprints in a week.

Now, each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total distance would be the number of sprints multiplied by the distance per sprint. That would be 9 sprints times 60 meters. Let me do that math. 9 times 60... Well, 9 times 6 is 54, so 540 meters.

Wait, let me check again. 3 sprints per day for 3 days is 3*3=9 sprints. Each sprint is 60 meters, so 9*60. 60*9: 60*10 is 600, minus 60 is 540. Yeah, that seems right. So the total is 540 meters per week. I think that's it.

James runs 3 sprints each day for 3 days a week, totaling $3 \times 3 = 9$ sprints per week. Each sprint is 60 meters, so the total distance is $9 \times 60 = 540$ meters.

#### 540
